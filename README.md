     Review original code and refactor the code to make it efficent and fast.

## Results

    Compiled the results in two sections 
    1. Stock performance analysis
    2. Execution Times between original and refactor code

### Stock performances

    Based on history data for two years (2017 & 2018),

    - Only two stocks provided good returns in both years (ENPH and RUN) and the same reflects in the 
    volume growth of these two stock tradings

    - 10 out of 12 stocks underperformed in 2018

### Execution Times
    
    Refactored code runs with an improvement of **87%** in execution time compared to original code. 
    Run time improved from 0.55 secs to 0.07 secs.
